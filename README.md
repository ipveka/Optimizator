# üõ†Ô∏è Optimizer

**Optimizer** is a project for inventory optimization in supply chains using advanced simulation and machine learning techniques. It streamlines inventory management by providing tools for supply planning and inventory control. The project includes classes for each stage, from data preparation to evaluation, making it versatile for various supply chain scenarios.

This project uses **simulated data** to demonstrate its capabilities, providing a practical, scalable framework for real-world applications.

- **`docs`**  
  Comprehensive documentation detailing the project's classes, functions, architecture, and usage instructions.

- **`notebooks`**  
  Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the **Simulator** workflow:
  - **`simulation`**: Step-by-step walkthrough of simulation.
  - **`optimization`**: Demonstrates inventory modeling, optimization and evaluation.
  - **`runner`**: An end-to-end workflow combining all pipeline steps for a complete inventory optimization scenario.

- **`utils`**  
  Core utility folder containing classes, auxiliary functions, and visualization tools for the project:
  - **`simulator.py`**  
    Contains the **Simulator** class, which provides tools for generating and managing simulated supply chain scenarios.
